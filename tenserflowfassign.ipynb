    "### Part 1: Theoretical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What are the different data structures used in TensorFlow? Give some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, the primary data structures are tensors. Tensors are generalizations of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. They are the central unit of data in TensorFlow and are used for representing the data for both inputs and outputs of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of TensorFlow Data Structures:**\n",
    "- **tf.Tensor:** The basic unit of data in TensorFlow. It can have various ranks, shapes, and types.\n",
    "- **tf.Variable:** A special type of tensor that represents a modifiable tensor and is used for storing and updating parameters during training.\n",
    "- **tf.constant:** An immutable tensor whose value is constant and cannot be changed.\n",
    "- **tf.SparseTensor:** A tensor that efficiently represents tensors with a large proportion of zero elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Constant:**\n",
    "- A constant is an immutable tensor whose value cannot be changed after it is created.\n",
    "- It is defined using `tf.constant`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Variable:**\n",
    "- A variable is a modifiable tensor whose value can be changed during the execution of the program.\n",
    "- It is used for storing model parameters and is defined using `tf.Variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "'''\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# TensorFlow constant\n",
    "const = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], name=\"const\")\n",
    "print(\"TensorFlow Constant:\", const)\n",
    "\n",
    "# TensorFlow variable\n",
    "var = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3], name=\"var\")\n",
    "print(\"TensorFlow Variable:\", var)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the variable\n",
    "var.assign([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "print(\"Modified TensorFlow Variable:\", var)\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "#### 3. Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Addition:**\n",
    "- Performed using the `tf.add` function or the `+` operator.\n",
    "- Adds corresponding elements of two matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Multiplication:**\n",
    "- Performed using the `tf.matmul` function or the `@` operator.\n",
    "- Computes the dot product of two matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Element-wise Operations:**\n",
    "- Performed using functions like `tf.multiply` or the `*` operator.\n",
    "- Applies the operation to each element individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
